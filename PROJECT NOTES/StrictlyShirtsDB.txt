If the database gets deleted
run the project and then in the new window in the url add /phpmyadmin
sign is as username = strictlyShirts password = strictlyShirts
then create the database strictly_shirts if it does not exist
once you have navigated to the data base download the StrictlyShirtsDB.sql file and import it into the database
