when starting anew page use the require 'connection.php' file
this will set a global variable $conn to the mysql connection

PHP is special and we do not have to worry about closing the connection
because it will automatically do this for up once the php is done executing

when running a sql script use the global variable $conn and the query or stored proc to 
get the results.
